# CIT 128 Project: Student Directed Project Directions

**Version:** 12/20/2021

## Directions

CIT 128 is a software engineering course focused on the application of software engineering techniques for the design and development of large programs.

In this project, you will take what you have learned about software engineering and decide on an individual Python programming project in consolation with me. You will need to design a program that utilizes the elements learned in this class as well as Python I. This will be a challenge as there will be no demo versions and if you want unit tests, you will need to design them.

As your project is unique, you will be required to help craft your rubric and grading scale as part of the program description. This will be completed as a part of the project drafts.

Note, there are requirements on how often you must commit your work to GitHub and the number of lines of code expected to be a large program. This means you will need to be working on it each week rather than cramming it in at the end.

## Rubric / Grading Scale

There are two parts to the grading rubric, the instructor provided rubric and the student provided rubric. The instructor provided rubric is worth 50 points may not be modified by the student and consists of requirements that all students must achieve regardless of individual project description or goals. 

The student provided rubric is worth 150 points and is specific to the individual student directed project description. Students may decide how to divide up the points in consultation with the instructor. Specific goals with point allocations must be given in the rubric to be accepted or the instructor may choose to modify the rubric or points distribution at any time.

* **Instructor Rubric (50pt)**
  * Update README.md: Update the Student Name, CRN, & Semester / Year. (2pt)
  * Update README.md: Add a description of the program that includes the goals of the program. (5pt)
  * Update README.md: Add a description of the software engineering techniques used for the design & development of this program. (5pt)
  * Update README.md: Provide a link to a video recording demonstrating the working application. (10pt)
  * GitHub Commits: Weekly programming commits showing progress from Week 9 - Week 16. (8pt)
  * Lines of Code: Write a minimum of 500 - 1000 lines of code. Markdown files and third-party libraries or modules do not count towards the line count but may be used. (20pt)
* **Student Rubric (150pt)**
  * Core Features Completed (20 pt each)
      * Dialogue displays on the screen gradually as user iterates through the game
      * Click to continue
      * Start screen and Game Over screen
  * Bonus Features Completed (10 pt each)
      * Resizable GUI window
      * Smooth transition between scenes
      * Decision timer (10 sec) or else it autoselects decision A over decision B
      * If user selects Continue, on the Game Over screen, it displays scenes traversed during the previous iteration of the game and allows the user to select a story point to revive from
  * Zybook Concepts Used (25 pt)
      * Multiple concepts were used
      * Concepts were used wisely
  * Clean Code (25 pt)
      * Readable
      * Highly cohesive
      * Low coupling

Total Points: 200

### Additional Grading Notes

* Customers will not pay for programs that do not work, programs that do not run due to syntax errors will receive __0 Points__.
* Programmers tend to forget how large programs work over time, as a result up to __5 Points__ may be taken for programs that do not have a _reasonable_ amount of comments that describe key sections of code.
* All programs must have your Github URL submitted in Canvas via the assignment page. Unsubmitted Github repos will receive __0 Points__.
* Programs that have been submitted and received a grade will not be regraded, unless the instructor makes a request for changes.
* If a program is eligible for regrading, it is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor when the program is ready for regrading.
* Professional programmers are required to hit tough deadlines, late assignments will loose __20 Points__.
* While automated unit tests may be used, manual testing of your code is also required. 
* Review of the coding style will be used in grading. Up to __20 points__ may be taken if the code does not meet the instructions in the directions.
* Submitted code may be subject to inspection by the [Measure of Software Simularity (MOSS)](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) to check for simularity in programs that may be related to plagerism. It is up to the instructor to determine if plagarism is occuring.
* Programmers need to treat any logins or API keys as confidential information that should never be published to GitHub. Confidential information published to GitHub will loose __5 Points__.
